## Search Engines & Security Research

---

### 1. Credible Sources
- Always ensure sources are **credible**.  
- Look for **consistency and agreement** across multiple independent sources.  
- Evaluate the **objective** behind the information (bias vs factual evidence).  

---

### 2. Search Engine Operators & Techniques
- **Exact Phrase Search**: Use quotes `" "` → `"cyber warfare report"`.  
- **File Type Filter**: `filetype:pdf cyber warfare report`.  
- **Exclude Results**: Use minus sign `-` → `cybersecurity -jobs`.  
- **Site-Specific Search**: `site:.gov cyber policy`.

### 3. Linux Tools for Networking
- **ss (socket statistics)**  
  - Modern replacement for `netstat`.  
  - Displays socket and connection info.  

---

### 4. Cryptography Caution
- Beware of **snake oil cryptography** → bogus or unproven cryptographic methods marketed as secure without real validation.  

---

### 5. Vulnerability Databases
- **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**  
  - A **dictionary of publicly known vulnerabilities**.  
  - Provides a **standardized identifier** for each vulnerability.  
  - Used globally in security advisories, scanners, and patch management.
